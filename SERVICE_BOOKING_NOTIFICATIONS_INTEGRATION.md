# Service Booking Notifications Integration

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED INTEGRATION**

I've successfully integrated push notifications into your service booking system. Now when you accept or approve service requests from the dashboard, users will receive push notifications on their phones.

## üîß **What Was Updated**

### 1. **ServiceBookingsManagement.js**
- ‚úÖ Added notification imports and hooks
- ‚úÖ Updated "Confirm" button to send booking confirmation notifications
- ‚úÖ Updated "Reject" button to send rejection notifications  
- ‚úÖ Updated status update function to send notifications for all status changes

### 2. **ServiceBookingRequests.js**
- ‚úÖ Added notification imports and hooks
- ‚úÖ Updated `handleStatusUpdate` function to send notifications for all status changes
- ‚úÖ Added notifications for: confirmed, in_progress, completed, cancelled

## üì± **How It Works Now**

### When You Accept a Service Request:
1. **Dashboard Action**: Click "Confirm" on a service booking
2. **Database Update**: Booking status changes to "confirmed"
3. **Push Notification**: User receives notification on their phone
4. **Message**: "Your service booking for '[Service Name]' has been confirmed! Our team will contact you soon to schedule the service."

### When You Reject a Service Request:
1. **Dashboard Action**: Click "Reject" on a service booking
2. **Database Update**: Booking status changes to "rejected"
3. **Push Notification**: User receives notification on their phone
4. **Message**: "Your service booking for '[Service Name]' has been reviewed but cannot be approved at this time. Please contact the management office for more information."

### When You Update Status:
1. **Dashboard Action**: Change booking status (pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
2. **Database Update**: Status updates in Firestore
3. **Push Notification**: User receives appropriate notification
4. **Different Messages**: Based on the new status

## üéØ **Status-Specific Notifications**

| Status | Notification Message |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Confirmed** | "Your service booking has been confirmed! Our team will contact you soon." |
| **In Progress** | "Work has started on your service booking. Our team is now working on your request." |
| **Completed** | "Your service booking has been completed! Thank you for using our services." |
| **Cancelled** | "Your service booking has been cancelled. Please contact the management office if you have any questions." |
| **Rejected** | "Your service booking has been reviewed but cannot be approved at this time." |

## üöÄ **Testing the Integration**

### 1. **Test from Dashboard:**
1. Go to your dashboard
2. Navigate to Service Bookings
3. Find a pending service request
4. Click "Confirm" or "Reject"
5. Check the user's phone for the notification

### 2. **Test Status Updates:**
1. Open a service booking
2. Change the status using the dropdown
3. Save the changes
4. Check the user's phone for the notification

### 3. **Check Console Logs:**
Look for these messages in the browser console:
- `"Booking confirmation notification sent"`
- `"Booking status notification sent"`
- `"Mobile push notification result: {...}"`

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### If Notifications Don't Appear:

1. **Check FCM Token Registration:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
   // Look for: users/{userId}/tokens/{tokenId}
   // Verify tokens exist and are active
   ```

2. **Check Push Notification Queue:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
   // Look for: pushNotifications collection
   // Check if notifications are being queued
   ```

3. **Check Cloud Functions:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   # Look for processing errors
   ```

4. **Check Mobile App:**
   - Ensure FCM is properly configured
   - Check notification permissions
   - Verify the app is receiving tokens

### Common Issues:

1. **"No FCM tokens found"**: User needs to open mobile app to register token
2. **"Failed to send notification"**: Check Cloud Functions deployment
3. **Notifications stuck in pending**: Check FCM API is enabled

## üìã **Files Modified**

Now when you accept or approve service requests from the dashboard, users will automatically receive push notifications on their mobile phones! The system is fully integrated and ready to use.

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify FCM tokens are registered in Firestore
3. Check Cloud Functions logs
4. Test with the PushNotificationTest component

The integration is complete and should work immediately!
