# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Summary - Notification Bug

## The Problem
When you updated a booking status for **one user**, notifications were sent to **all users**.

## The Cause
A critical Cloud Function (`sendNotificationOnCreate`) was missing. Your code created notification documents correctly with a single user ID, but there was no backend function to process them.

## The Fix
âœ… Added the missing `sendNotificationOnCreate` Cloud Function to `functions/index.js`

This function:
- Reads the `audience.uids` array from notification documents
- Sends notifications **ONLY** to users specified in that array
- Handles all audience types (specific users, all users, units, buildings, topics)
- Automatically marks invalid tokens as inactive
- Updates notification status after sending

## Deploy The Fix

### Option 1: Use the deployment script (Easiest)
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre-dashboard
./deploy-notification-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre-dashboard
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Test The Fix

1. Open your dashboard
2. Find a booking for a specific user
3. Update the booking status (e.g., from "pending" to "confirmed")
4. **Expected result:** ONLY that user receives a notification
5. **Before fix:** All users in the project would receive it
